It is the subbands 200..231

You can calculate the frequencies as follows:

center freq = (512 + subbandId) * (clockFreq/1024)

In our case, the clock frequency is 200 MHz.

center freq first subband = (512 + 200) * (200/1024) = 139.0625 MHz
center freq 2nd subband   = (512 + 201) * (200/1024) = 139.258  MHz
etc.

So, the width of a suband is 200/1024 = 195.3125 KHz.
We have 16 channels per subband, so the width of a channel is 12.207 KHz...

However, the frequencies above are the CENTER frequencies of a subband.
So, the start frequency = centerFrequency - ((nrChannels / 2) * channelBandwidth)

So, the start freq channel 0, subband 200 = 138.96484375 MHz
and the end freq of channel 15 subband 31 = 145.21484375 MHz
So, the entire frequency range for this observation is 6.25 MHz


It is pulsar B1919+21, with a period of 1.3373 seconds and a pulse width of 0.04 second, and DM = 12.455.
